# Halo-4-Material-Importer
Imports Halo 4 .material files into Blender

## How to Use
First, you need to install the zip, then set your H4EK path. Make sure you run "H4EK (Extract).bat" to make sure the tags are extracted.
Then press "Export All Bitmaps" this will dump 25GB of bitmap files into your H4EK/Images folder and will take a while.
Once all bitmaps have been extracted you can click on the "Halo 4 Material Importer" tab in the viewport, select the objects you want to set up, and press "Run Material Importer"

Note: This tool **only** works with [Reclaimer](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer) RMF file imports
